%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

This plugin allows to render a link to a web. While linking to a topic is quite essential to wikis,
linking to a web as an object of the wiki isn't that well supported. Most commonly a link to a web points
to the !%HOMETOPIC% topic of a web which serves as the entry point for all of the web. That's
what %WEBLINK does as well. In addition it supports formatting the link in a custom way to
display a more meaningful link text than the normal !WebHome text. If you optionally installed
Foswiki:Extensions/DBCachePlugin, the %WEBLINK will be displaying the !TopicTitle of the target topic.
Otherwise the normal topic name will be displayed as link text.
